# Switchplay

A working prototype for a data-driven player development platform for football academies, designed to be used by players, coaching staff, and multidisciplinary teams of staff that included sports scientists, medical professionals, psychologists, and other stakeholders.

This prototype is responsive to laptop, table and mobile screens. However, a fully productionised version will only be released in conjunction with a React Native mobile app, because players in particular are more likely to engage via a mobile app, and this tool is a player-centred tool.

The code is not productionised - it is to be used for iterative design, demos and small scale trials with non-sensitive data and non-critical clients, such as staff and players from a lower league/semi-professional football club.

## Iterations

There have been 3 main iterations. All remain in the main branch at the moment(this will change), but only Cards is rendered.

Most Recent: Cards https://github.com/petedomokos/switchplay/tree/master/client/core/cards 

Previous: Milestones Bar https://github.com/petedomokos/switchplay/blob/master/client/core/journey/MilestonesBar.js

Initial: Journey https://github.com/petedomokos/switchplay/blob/master/client/core/journey/Journey.js

## Visuals

There are some visuals here at the moment which users can select as a window into a particular dataset that is part of a players journey/target. These are due to be removed into a separate Visualisations package, but for now, there loactions are as follows:

The 4 Quadrant Bar Chart https://github.com/petedomokos/switchplay/tree/master/client/visuals/quadrantBarChart

Bee Swarm Plot https://github.com/petedomokos/switchplay/tree/master/client/charts/beeswarm
